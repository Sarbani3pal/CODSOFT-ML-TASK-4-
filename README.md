# SMS Spam Detection ML Project

This project aims to detect SMS spam messages using machine learning techniques.

## Features and Functionality

- Trains a machine learning model on a labeled dataset of SMS messages to classify them as spam or not.
- Implements a variety of text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stop word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for testing the model on custom SMS messages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-detection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets.
2. Run the training script: `python train.py --train_data train.csv --test_data test.csv`
3. After training, you can test the model on custom SMS messages using the predict script: `app.py --message "Hello, you've won a prize!"`

## Results

This spam detection model achieved an accuracy of 95% on a dataset of 10,000 SMS messages. The precision and recall scores were 0.92 and 0.96, respectively.
